# Cleaning pipleine for FY2021-2024 FOIA data
# Source: https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/2024-h1b-immigration-data
# Universe: all H-1B lottery winners who filed petitions
#
# *** MODIFIED VERSION: Preserves 2010 SOC codes alongside 2018 crosswalked codes ***
# This version adds SOC_CODE_2010 and SOC_TITLE_2010 columns to preserve the
# original vintage SOC codes from the LCA data before the 2018 crosswalk is applied.

# Date last edited: 10.20.2025
# Modified: 2026-01-16 to preserve 2010 SOC codes

# Steps:
  # clean and combine 2015-2024 LCA entries
  # load 2021-2024 FOIA I-129 data and re-name variables for ease of use
  # filter for only lottery winners who filed petitions for H1-Bs
  # merge in LCA data to obtain SOC codes, LCA application addresses, and OES wage levels
  # clean wage data
  # identify potential duplicates
  # implement new wage level ranking rule as follows
  #   (1) merge with HUD zip code to county crosswalk
  #   (2) for those with missing zip codes, invalid zip codes, or low overlapping area zip codes, geocode using arcgis
  #   (3) link the geocoded addresses to counties by spatial geometry
  #   (4) merge the zip-based and geocoded counties and crosswalk counties to CBSA
  #   (5) merge CBSA to MSAs, manually correct for New England townships
  #   (6) crosswalk 2010 SOC occupation codes used by old LCA entries to 2018 SOCs
  #   (7) first pass on those without SOC occupations via string similarity on DOT codes and free string job titles
  #   (8) second pass on those without SOC occupations via machine learning on company names, degree fields, job titles, and DOT codes of entries with SOC codes
  #   (9) entries that still have no SOC matches cannot be merged with OFLC wage levels; use LCA wage levels for these and filter out those without LCA wage levels
  #   (10) adjust 2021-2023 wages by the ratio of average wage for the corresponding MSA-SOC combination in 2024 OES over the average wage for the given year-MSA-SOC combo
  #   (11) merge with 2024-2025 OFLC wage levels and determine wage levels with the time-adjusted I-129 wages
  #   (12) wherever the wage is lower than OFLC Level I lower bound, re-label as wage level I
  #   (13) wherever the LCA wage levels cannot be determined, fall back to LCA wage levels
  # remove extraneous variables and export cleaned data by year
